# Handling Imbalanced Data

THIS IS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL REPO -> https://github.gatech.edu/abb9/MLProject.git

Using Credit card fraud detection dataset gotten from -> https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
an analysis is performed on different methods of handling imbalance between classes.
[this is a group project in which i was tasked with resampling of the data using different methods. I wrote an implemetation of an oversampling technique in MATLAB (MWMOTE.m), using this and other resampling techniques to generate datasets for classifier training]
